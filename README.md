Chemistry + Python: Web UI Projects
This repository contains a collection of small web projects that convert Python-based chemistry problem solvers into simple interactive webpages.

ðŸ“š About
A friend of mine is working through a Udemy course titled "Chemistry + Python: Solve Chemistry Problems with Python." To help add a UI aspect to the projects, Iâ€™m converting his Python scripts into basic static webpages with simple user interfaces.

This project serves two goals:

Help my friend showcase his chemistry tools in a user-friendly way.

Help me learn how to translate basic Python logic into static web pages using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

ðŸš€ Projects
Each project in this repository represents a small tool that solves a specific chemistry problem.
